//variable and datatypes
// 1. How do we assign a value to a variable? 
// We assign a value to a variable by using the assignment (=) operatorto assign a value to varianble or property.
//2. How do we change the value of a variable?
// the first and easiest way of changing a value of a variable is simply to reaasign it:
//example, let numberOfCats = 3; numberOfCats = 4;
//3. what are declare, assign, define:
// declare use var(only in older programs), let, const
// assign using the assignment opperator
// define a variable is to give the variable a value.
//5. what is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
// pseudocoding is using plain language to discribe what the code is doing. We should use it to help process the logic you indend to execute.
// 6. what percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
// you should spend over half the time planning (over 60%), the time should be spent in solving the actual coding should take less time.
