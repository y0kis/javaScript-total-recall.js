//variable and datatypes
// 1. How do we assign a value to a variable? 
// We assign a value to a variable by using the assignment (=) operatorto assign a value to varianble or property.
//2. How do we change the value of a variable?
// The first and easiest way of changing a value of a variable is simply to reaasign it:
//example, let numberOfCats = 3; numberOfCats = 4;
// 3. What are declare, assign and define?
// Declare use var(only in older programs), let,const
//Assign using the assignment aperator 
//Define a variable is to give the varaible a value.
//5.What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
//Pseudocoding is using plain language to describe what the code is doing. We should use it to help process the logic you intend to execute.
//6.What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
//You should spend over half the time planning (over 60%), the time should be spent in solving the actual coding should take less time.


// B STRINGS
// let firstVariable = "Hello World";
// firstVariable = 32;
//let secondVariable = firstVariable;
//secondVariable = "Nice!"
//console.log(firstVariable);
//let yourName = "Mary";
//let greeting = `Hello, my name is ${yourName}`;
//console.log(greeting);

// BOOLEANS
///const a = 4;
//const b = 53;
//const c = 57;
//const d = 16;
//const e = 'Kevin';
//console.log(a != b);

//BOOLEANS
const a = 4;
const b = 53;
const c = 57;
const d = 16;
const e = 'Kevin';
console.log(a != b);
console.log(c != d);
console.log('Name' == 'Name');

//FOR THE NEXT TWO, USE ONLY && OR ||
console.log(true || false);
console.log(false && false && false || true);
console.log(false == false);
console.log(e == 'Kevin');
console.log(a < b != c);
console.log(a == a != d);
console.log(48 == '48');

//if animal is a cow print moooooo
//if the animal is not a cow print "Hey! You're not a cow."

let animal ="cow";
